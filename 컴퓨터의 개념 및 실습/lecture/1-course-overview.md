# Academic Integrity (in Programming)

* It is OK to discuss general ideas and overall strategies, but you should work on your own writing your programs.
    * Help your classmates in a constructive way!


* Rule 1: You must indicate any assistance you received.
    * on your submission as part of comments at the beginning of your code 
    
    
* Rule 2: You must not share actual program code with other students.


* Rule 3: You must not look at solution sets or program code from other years.


* Rule 4: You must be prepared to explain any program code you submit.
